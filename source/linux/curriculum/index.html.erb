    <h3>Choosing a Linux Distribution</h3>
</a>
<p class="doc">
    If you're just starting out with Linux, don't fret about which distribution to use.  You should probably just use Ubuntu, or whatever distro your friend that wants to get you into Linux uses.
</p>
<p class="doc">
    Ubuntu has been the most popular Linux distro for a while now, which means it's well supported(lots of answers to your questions online in google or online forums) and it's easy to use and install, with minimal bugs.  You can find Ubuntu here:

        <%= link_to "#{image_tag("http://design.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/ubuntu-orange.gif")}", "https://www.ubuntu.com", target: "_blank" %>
    </div>
</p>

<p class="doc">
    Here is an <%= link_to "askubuntu.com", "http://askubuntu.com", target: "_blank", class: "inline" %> forum posting that has a guide on how to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox:

<p class="doc">
    If all you've ever used is Ubuntu, you wouldn't be getting a total view of Linux, CentOS is an alternative distribution of LInux built on Redhat(instead of Debian)  Debian and Redhat do many of the basic Linux tasks in different ways.  They use different package managers and slightly different file layouts.  If you were to only have experience with one, you might feel a little lost the first time you tried to use the other(when apt-get did not work).  Fedora is a good end-user version of Redhat Linux, and CentOS is a production version one that is used by companies in datacenters.

    <h3>Installing Linux</h3>
</a>
<p class="doc">
    Installing Linux, especially these days is about as easy as installing windows or Mac OS X.  When you download and install any of the available Distro's they will come with an installation wizard to help guide you.  But let's say you wanted to go a bit deeper in understanding what exactly Linux is doing to your computer.  There are a few ways to do that.
</p>

<h4>Arch linux</h4>

</p>

<h4>Linux from Scratch</h4>
<p>
    Everyone should do this at least once.  Linux from Scratch isn't even an iso or piece of software that you download.  It's just a document, and that document details exactly how to set up a Linux box down to every last detail.  You'll be installing the kernel yourself, downloading and managing compilers, setting up mount points and manually creating many of the configuration files in /etc.
</p>
<p>
    I would rarely recommend ever using a Linux from Scratch box, unless, for example you are trying to create an embedded version of Linux or are trying to create your own distro.

<h4>Logging in</h4>
<p class="doc">
	Once you are done installing and reboot your linux machine it will be time to log in.  You will probably have created a user to login with.  This user will have a set of permissions designed to protect you from accidentally causing too much damage to the system.  

    But sometimes you need to get into the system level functions.  Whenever you are making low level changes to the system, perhaps configuring a new network or installing a new application.  You will need "root" access.  Root is the Linux/Unix term for administrator or power user.  

    For clarity, "root" has two meanings in Linux as you'll see 
</p>

<h4>The Linux Command Line</h4>
<p class="doc">
    Sure, as a user of Linux on the desktop, you can use most modern distributions of Linux without touching the command line, just as you might a Windows or Mac.  Baut the power in Linux ( and modern Mac/OS X machines) is in being able to use the command line.  
</p>

<h5>The Command Prompt</h5>
<p class="doc">
    You could and will spend years; youre whole career even mastering the commands of the Linux operating system.  Using these commands together with "shell scripting"  -- an integrated lite programming language built into the operating system provides a powerful way to interact with both the local and remote systems.
</p>
<h5>One Function Per Command</h5>
<p class="doc">
    Linux/Unix has a philosophy of providing modular components.  This means that each command usually has one specific function it provides, and you can combine multiple commands to do more complex tasks.  This often involveds "piping" the output of one command into the input of another command.

    For instance, the "grep" command is used to print the lines of a file that match (or don't match) a certain string.  "cat" can be used to print out the contents of a file, so you can take the output of the cat command and pipe it to the grep command:

<code>
cat cats.txt |grep tabby
</code>
</p>

<h4>The Linux File System</h4>
<p class="doc">
	It all starts with root (/).
